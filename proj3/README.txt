 The Backward compatibility works with the Proj1 and Proj2 that I have submitted earlier.All the testcase pass successfully.

It gives some error for some testcase with heapfile and hfpage project that are given in proj3 directory I am not able to understand why.

Hence please check compatibility with my earlier submitted project not the one included in proj3.


 Please check it on my earlier project.

 I have added my required files for proj2
1. heapfile.C
2. hfPage.C
3. scan.C

for proj1
1.hfPage.C


Thank You,

Royan
