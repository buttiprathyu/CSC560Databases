**** Project 5: Sort-merge Join Implementation ****

<< Files included >>

./lib:

libdb.a: DB library

---

./src:

buf.C: This has empty body. You can replace this file with your buffer manager used for project 3.

heapfile.C: This has empty body. You can replace this file with your heapfile.C used for project 2.

hfpage.C: This has empty body. You can replace this file with your hfpage.C used for project 1.

main.C, test_driver.C, SMJTester.C: the testing programs

scan.C: This has empty body. You can replace this file with your scan.C used for project 2. 
In addition, you need to implement position() and mvNext(), which were not required in project 2.

sortMerge.C: source code for the sortMerge class implementation. You need to implement this.

sort.o: implementation of an external sort algorithm

Other .C files: Same as the ones used in the previous projects.

expected_output: results of running the test driver using a correct implementation

----

../include:

buf.h, heapfile.h, hfpage.h, scan.h: specifications for the BufMgr, HeapFile, HFPage, and Scan classes implemented in the previous projects. 

SMJTester.h, test_driver.h: the header file for the SMJtester

sortMerge.h: the interface of the sortMerge class.

sort.h: the interface for the external sorting algorithm.

Other .h files: Same as the ones used in the previous projects.
