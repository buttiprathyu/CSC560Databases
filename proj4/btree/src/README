All the files in this directory:

Makefile: a sample makefile

btfile.C, btindex_page.C, btleaf_page.C, btreefilescan.C:
you need to write these .C files and their corresponding .h files in ../include.

buf.C: This has empty body. You can replace this file with your buffer manager used for project 2.

main.C, btree_driver.C, keys: these are the test driver

sorted_page.C: You also need to implement this.

hfpage.C: This has empty body. You can replace this file with your hfpage used for project 1.

Other .C files: They are same as ones used in projects 1 and 2.

expected_output: results of running the test driver using a correct implementation
