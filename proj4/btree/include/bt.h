#ifndef BT_H

/*
 * This file contains, among other things, the interface to our
 * key (void*) abstraction.  The BTLeafPage and BTIndexPage code
 * know very little about the various key types.  In fact, only 
 * a very small amount of work would be required to make those 
 * classes share almost all of their code (e.g., by creating a class
 * `BTPage' derived from SortedPage and from which BTLeafPage and 
 * BTIndexPage themselves drive).  
 *
 * Essentially we provide a way for those classes to package and 
 * unpackage <key,data> pairs in a space-efficient manner.  That is, the 
 * packaged result contains the key followed immediately by the data value; no 
 * padding bytes are used (not even for alignment). 
 *
 * Furthermore, the BT<*>Page classes need
 * not know anything about the possible AttrType values, since all 
 * their processing of <key,data> pairs is done by the functions 
 * declared here.
 *
 * In addition to packaging/unpacking of <key,value> pairs, we 
 * provide a keyCompare function for the (obvious) purpose of
 * comparing keys of arbitrary type (as long as they are defined 
 * here).
